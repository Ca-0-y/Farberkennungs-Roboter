#Farberkennungs-Roboter

## Overview

### Description of Project

The software is for programming a line follower that can recognize colors. When recognizing black and white, the motors move alternately at different speeds to follow the line. When colors are detected, the motors rotate at the same speed and the color order is detected. Depending on the color order, the loudspeaker plays sounds, the LEDs light up or the motors rotate for a certain time.
